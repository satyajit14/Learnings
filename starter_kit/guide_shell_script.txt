1. Create a file with .sh extension in any text editor
2. Start the file with: #!/bin/bash
    - this tells ubuntu that this is supposed to be executed by bash
3. Echo statements:
    - echo "Hello World"
    - kind of like a print statement

4. Variable creation:
    - myName="Satyajit"
    - Note:
        - all variables are stored as strings
        - during variable creation do not have any white spaces around the "=" signs

5. Declaring constants:
    - declare -r NUM1=5

6. Arithmetic operation:
    - echo $((5+4))
    - generally non st
7. Function definitions:
    myfunction(){
      echo "This is from a function"
      var="Success"

      return var
    }

    myfunction

8. Conditional Statements:

    1. Format:
      if [[-e file.txt]]; then
        do something
      else
        do something
      fi

    2. Common examples if if statements:
      -e file
          True if file exists
      -d file
          True if file exists and is a directory.
      -f file
          True if file exists and is a regular file.
      -z string
          True if empty string
      -n string
          True if not empty string
      string1 = string2
          True if string1 and string2 are equal.
      string == pattern
          True if string matches pattern. (pattern has the same form as a pattern in filename expansion; for example, unquoted * means "zero or more characters".)
      string != pattern
          True if string does not match pattern.

9. For loops:
    1. Format:
      for i in {1..10} ; do
        echo i
      done
